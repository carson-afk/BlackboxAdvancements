## Notes

- This site is fully static and GitHub Pages safe.
- The contact form currently uses a `mailto:` action for static compatibility.
- Replace `hello@blackboxadvancements.com` with the final business inbox if needed.
- If you want a real submission endpoint later, connect the form to Formspree, Basin, a Cloudflare Worker, or another static-friendly form handler.
